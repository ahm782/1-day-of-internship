# Internship Day 1 – Python Basics

This repository documents my first day of internship, where I focused on understanding and applying the core fundamentals of Python programming. The structure of this learning is presented using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result), followed by a summary of the impact.

---

##  Summary

### ✅ Situation
On the first day of my internship, I was introduced to Python as the primary programming language for automation and scripting tasks. My task was to get comfortable with Python syntax and explore how basic operations work in an interactive environment.

---

### ✅ Task
The primary task was to build a foundational understanding of Python’s behavior through:
- Taking user input
- Performing simple arithmetic
- Manipulating and formatting strings
- Applying built-in functions and methods
- Understanding data types and operator precedence

---

### ✅ Action
To accomplish the task:
- I practiced capturing and displaying user input with `input()` and `print()`
- Explored string formatting using both concatenation and f-strings
- Worked with built-in string methods such as `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.replace()`, and `.find()`
- Performed simple operations like age calculation, weight conversion, and rounding values
- Observed how indexing and slicing work on strings
- Experimented with operator precedence in mathematical expressions

---

### ✅ Result
- Successfully understood how Python handles strings, numbers, and user interaction
- Developed confidence in writing clean and simple Python expressions
- Learned how to structure outputs and format user-driven input
- Completed all tasks independently and laid the foundation for future Python development

---

## 🌟 Impact

This exercise laid the groundwork for:
- Writing basic Python scripts confidently
- Understanding how to take and process user input
- Preparing for more advanced topics like conditional logic, loops, and functions
- Improving overall programming logic and syntax familiarity

By starting with simple concepts and practicing them through examples, I’ve built a solid base to tackle more complex tasks in the upcoming days of the internship.

## 📌 Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a personal and professional log of my learning progress during the internship. It helps document what I’ve practiced and acts as a reference point for future review and demonstration.

---

## 🔮 Future To-Dos

- Learn `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements
- Explore loops (`for`, `while`)
- Work with lists and dictionaries
- Build simple decision-based programs
- Understand functions and reusability
- Handle exceptions and invalid inputs
